// Context carries per-dispatch state. One Context is created for each
// Emit and shared by every listener and middleware that runs during that
// dispatch, which makes it the channel through which listeners cooperate:
// a validator can stash a parsed value with Set and a later persister can
// read it with Get.
//
// # Lifetime
//
// A Context is valid only for the duration of the dispatch that created
// it. Contexts are pooled and reused, so retaining one after Emit returns
// (or after an async listener finishes) will observe another dispatch's
// state. Copy anything you need instead.
//
// Async dispatch is the exception: a Context handed to async listeners is
// not pooled, because the dispatcher cannot know when the last listener
// has finished without adding synchronisation to the hot path.
//
// # Concurrency
//
// Under [EmitAsync] the same Context is shared by listeners running on
// different goroutines. Cancel, Cancelled, Set, Get and the metadata
// accessors are therefore all safe for concurrent use. The immutable
// fields (Time, EventID, EventName, CorrelationID, RequestID) are written
// before any listener runs and only read afterwards.

	// EventName is the registered name of the event type, or its Go type
	// name when no name has been assigned via [Name].
	EventName string

	// CorrelationID ties a dispatch to a wider logical operation (a saga,
	// a job run, a trace). It is propagated to any event emitted through
	// this Context via [Context.Emitter].
	CorrelationID string

	// RequestID ties a dispatch to the inbound HTTP request or WebSocket
	// frame that triggered it.
	RequestID string

	// Ctx is the standard context governing the dispatch. It is never nil
	// during a dispatch; it defaults to context.Background().
